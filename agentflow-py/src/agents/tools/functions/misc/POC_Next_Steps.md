# Proof of Concept (POC) Next Steps

1. **Goal Definition**: We want to showcase an agent swarm using multi LLM modals and configurations.
2. **Feature Demonstration**: Autonomous agent swarm using multi LLM modals and configurations.
3. **Architecture Design**: Refer to https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat and Create a scalable and modular architecture, documenting decisions for future scalability.
4. **Multi-Modal Capabilities Integration**: Start with python fastapi websockets solution refer to the local directory.
5. **Demonstration and Feedback**: Proceed with implementation and writing files with proper names.
