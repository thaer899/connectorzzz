Dear Connectorzzz Team,

We are on the cusp of creating something groundbreaking: a multi-modal AI automation solution where each AI agent operates on a different device, yet all agents work in unison towards a common goal of smarter, more sustainable living.

To the Product Manager: You are tasked with overseeing this ecosystem of AI agents. Each agent is designed to perform tasks and assignments specific to its host device, creating a symphony of interconnected intelligence. Your vision should encompass not only the individual capabilities of each agent but also how they collectively contribute to a larger, cohesive system.

To the Business Analyst: Your role involves detailing the operational framework of these agents. Understand and define how these agents interact, share information, and learn from each other. Analyze the potential scenarios and use cases, focusing on the agents' customization aspects. Your insights will help tailor each agent to be effective in its designated environment, while also maintaining the flexibility to be customized by users according to their needs.

To the UX/UI Designer: You have the exciting challenge of designing interfaces that are intuitive yet complex enough to handle the depth of customization these agents offer. The UI needs to be user-friendly, allowing users to easily personalize their AI agents. It should also visually represent the interconnectedness of these agents in a clear and engaging manner, no matter the device or platform.

Our solution is not just about individual AI agents performing tasks. It's about creating a network of intelligent agents, each optimized for its specific environment yet capable of collaborating as part of a larger system. This system will bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds, offering users unprecedented control and customization options. Your combined efforts will be key to bringing this vision to life.

Let's work together to make this vision a reality, creating a product that is as versatile as it is innovative, paving the way for a smarter, more connected future

Once done write all outcome in file plan.md

Thaer
